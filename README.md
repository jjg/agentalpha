# agentalpha

An experimental Mastodon agent written in Python using the [ananas](https://github.com/chr-1x/ananas) framework.

This agent has no specific purpose but is a reusable identity for a number of experiments which if useful, will be given meaningful names and spun-out into their own repository.
